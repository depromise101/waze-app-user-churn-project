# Waze App User Churn Prediction & Retention

# Business Problem
My team is close to completing a churn project. Previously, we completed a project proposal, and used Python to explore and analyze Wazeâ€™s app user data, create data visualizations, and conduct a hypothesis test. Most recently, we built a binomial logistic regression model based on multiple variables.
 
Leadership appreciates all our hard work. Now, they want my team to build a machine learning model to predict user churn. To get the best results, my team decides to build and test two tree-based models: random forest and XGBoost.

The team work will help leadership make informed business decisions to prevent user churn, improve user retention, and grow Wazeâ€™s business.

# Project Goals
The goal of this model is to predict whether or not a Waze user is retained or churned.

# Project Purpose
The purpose of this model is to find factors that drive user churn.

# Skills and Tools Applied
ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Understanding & Preprocessing (pandas, numpy, sklearn)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Modeling: Random Forest & XGBoost (bootstrapping, gradient boosting, GridSearchCV, max_depth, n_estimators, learning_rate, subsample)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC, k-fold cross-validation or stratified CV)

ðŸ”¹ 4. Interpretability & Insights (Gini, Gain, matplotlib, seaborn, SHAP plots)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Visualization & Communication (matplotlib/seaborn/SHAP)
